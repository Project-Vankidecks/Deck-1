# Numerals 1–12 in Arabic (Modern Standard)

**Deck ID**: #1

## Rationale and usage

Taine-Cheikh (2008, p. 1) notes that "all numbers, apart from zero ( … ), are formed by a combination of a limited series of twelve numbers". The core, unavoidable numerical lexicon in Arabic thus comprises merely 12 terms. Numbers beyond 12 can be represented as a series of generalisable manipulations of those 12 essential terms. This deck is intended as a primer on Arabic numerals.

## Factual integrity

**<sup>a</sup>**

For a given Git commit, **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International licence** includes the most recent official English-language "Legal Code", and all its most recent translations authorised by Creative Commons, relative to the time at which the Git commit was merged or – only if the commit was directly pushed – committed into the master branch of this repository.

Should Creative Commons amend the texts of the 4.0 licence (e.g. for translation errors or minor typos), these amendments shall also retroactively apply to all prior Git merges and all direct commit pushes. For the avoidance of doubt, such a retroactive update shall in no way annul licences granted under terms prior to an amendment.

Should terms across any two applicable linguistic variants be in conflict, the terms which grant more liberty to the licensee shall apply.
